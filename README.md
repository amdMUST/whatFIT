# whatFIT 
### React Weather App | June 2020

A React Website that tells you the weather in your city while also telling you what to wear depending on your body type.
I built this site as an excersize to introduce myself to react. Hosted on Github using a CL script. 

This project was a great introduction to React and I plan to create more with it!
